# VisualMidi

This is a project for the "Creative Programming And Computing" course held at "Politecnico di Milano".

# Goals

The goal of this project is to give a graphical interpretation to MIDI messages coming from a Korg Minilogue, in such a way that graphical elements and audio stream are coherent. It is also implemented an integration with a Kemper Profiler that sends MIDI messages affecting the graphics.

# Where To Use
This program is thought to be used in live performances, both by bands and single artists.
